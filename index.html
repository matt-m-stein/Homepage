          <h2>A bit about myself</h2>
          <p>
            The start of each new day, is a chance to change something about
            yourself, a chance to try something new, or the chance to do
            something different. Life is about trying your hardest, including at
            trying your hardest. Self motivation is what makes the difference
            between being happy, and not. I like using the internet in my daily
            life so I am embarking on an adventure, I want a change, I want to
            become a web developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I try to learn a bit each day about being a front end web
            developer, I might manage to start a new career. This site is my
            homepage and on it I hope to showcase my portfolio as I progress
            into a web development career. If I could do freelance, I could
            travel, and if I could travel, I would be happier with my life. A
            chance at a new beginning is what I am hoping for, a chance to give
            back to the world wide web which has given me so much.
